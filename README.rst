SciELOtex is the first step to create some scripts to convert SPC, Jats and Bits XML Schemata to LaTeX.   

Here is the Bits, Jats and SPS to be described

| Left-aligned | Center-aligned | Right-aligned |

| git status   | git status     | git status    |
| git diff     | git diff       | git diff      |
